# Review record

## Accepted local-provider log-only slice

- Parent: accepted Slate/pooling contract commit `865f02e20be129c73b15e26d73570e6168ea16e5`.
- Accepted implementation candidate: `7387c66ab173d647494c282edf3fbbb0f55189d1`.
- Scope: provider-neutral memory/files adapter, bounded native group coordinator, log-only publication/recovery,
  provisional numeric-family CRUD, receipts, and deterministic storage faults.
- Acceptance boundary: this candidate does not claim authenticated remote-provider qualification, stable family
  creation authority, full Milestone 2 acceptance, MVCC isolation, or production durability/performance.
- Verification: on the final rebased source, `./scripts/check-repository.sh` validates canonical-state vectors,
  workloads, provenance, and repository shape; `./scripts/check-tla.sh` reports 112,031 TLC states at depth 14 and
  23/23 TLAPS obligations; and `./tests/scripts/test.sh` passes against memory/files, including a fresh-process files
  group crash/reopen probe. The warning-strict `./scripts/prove.sh` gate proves 421/421 checks: 84 flow and 337
  prover checks, with zero reported warnings, unproved or justified checks, or `pragma Assume` statements. The SPARK
  boundary is limited to selected deterministic packages documented in `proof-status.md`; storage I/O, lifecycle
  synchronization, and tasking are executable-test boundaries.
- Review status: accepted. The first implementation revision was rejected with P1 lifecycle, admission,
  reconciliation, deadline-isolation, identity, cap, and fault-evidence findings. Follow-up amendments reserve every
  admitted group/member identity, serialize shared storage-context fault controls and counters with a protected
  object, retain receipt identities on every admitted terminal path, and reject transaction-local reads and mutation
  buffering after a writer fence or uncertain publication. Expanded executable gates cover the 576-identity
  reservation boundary, a concurrent two-database shared-context case, and active read, buffered mutation,
  singleton/group admission, rollback, resolution, and recovery while a lost HEAD response leaves publication
  uncertain. Independent final re-review of the exact accepted candidate against the stated parent reports no
  P0, P1, P2, or P3 findings.

## Foundation root commit

- Parent: empty tree.
- Reviewer: independent read-only task `/root/foundation_review`.
- First reviewed revision: `c63cc5125c33c3ed256eaef100858d370f614e18`.
- First amended revision: `0ead79a74deb60d6400ab29262f81287814bb78c`.
- Final amended revision: `8b9ff8c338e4ffb346b0a18ff234646671dd2fd5`.
- Initial P1 findings: unreachable older batches, structurally unreachable HEAD images, and reconciliation dependent
  on unenforced transition-ID nonreuse.
- Initial P2/P3 findings: incomplete format corruption/golden coverage, overstated proof claims, permissive workload
  records, unassertive recovery workload, exposed internal children, own-write/read-capacity ordering, and unused
  AUnit.
- First follow-up P1 finding: an `Outcome_Unknown` commit remained replayable and receipt resolution was unrelated to
  the attempted transaction.
- First follow-up P2/P3 findings: equal transition/predecessor IDs remained structurally accepted, schema/validator
  drift was ungated, and planned tasking was described as implemented.
- Disposition: commit batches now require predecessor links; HEAD transitions carry monotonic ordinals and fail closed
  on unreachable shapes; reconciliation binds ID and ordinal; private units, exhaustive length/corruption tests, a
  fixed golden image, exact range deduplication, own-write ordering, operation-specific schema rules, schema-rule
  equivalence checks, receipt lifecycles, no-replay negative traces, and asserted recovery workloads were added.
  Proof documentation was narrowed, full range-union normalization was assigned to Milestone 3, and AUnit was removed.
- Verification: `./tests/scripts/test.sh`, `./scripts/prove.sh`, `./scripts/check-repository.sh`, and
  `git diff --check` pass. The current SPARK gate proves every reported check with no warning or unproved check.
- Follow-up status: accepted. The independent reviewer reported no P0, P1, P2, or P3 findings and reran every listed
  gate against the exact final revision with clean root and dependency worktrees.
